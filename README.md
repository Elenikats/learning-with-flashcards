# Learning with flashcards

In this project I focus more on the backend part and for this I used:

- Express.js,
- MongoDB,
- bcrypt,
- jwt.

The purpose of this project is for the user to be able to create different categories in which they can create flashcards. After logging in, they will be able to see and practice their saved flashcards and refesh their memory on what they have been learning. For example, at the moment I am learning web development so I could create a category of "Javascript". There I could save the definitions that I would like to practice learning and refer to after some time has passed and start forgetting. Each flashcard has a front and a back side. In the front the user can see the key word and in the back the definition of it.

In summary, the user is able to:

- register and login,
- create categories of topics intrested to learn,
- create flashcards.
